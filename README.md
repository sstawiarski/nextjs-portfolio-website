### Next.js Portfolio Website
#### Overview
Next.js Portfolio Website is my personal software engineer portfolio website. It is written using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The website is completely responsive, "dark mode"-ready, and completely static or server-side generated for the quickest load times.

#### Highlights
- Completely custom and responsive styling using the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) framework
- Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for the best error reduction
- Completely statically or server-side generated for fast load times
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) integration and custom models for interacting with a PostgreSQL database (hosted on AWS RDS, not included in repo)
- Email contact form implemented using AWS [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), AWS [SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), and AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

#### Live Demo
The portfolio is live at [shawnstawiarski.com](https://shawnstawiarski.com). It is hosted on Vercel using the Hobby tier.
